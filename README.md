#Digital Signature Demo Project

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how digital signatures work. The project includes a simple text editor where users can draw their signatures and save them as PNG images.

⚠️ Note: This project is for demonstration purposes only. It is not suitable for use in production. Proper digital signatures should be implemented using trusted third-party providers that comply with GDPR, ISO standards, and other relevant security regulations.
